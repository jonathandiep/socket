#Socket.IO

[PROJECT'S WEBSITE ON HEROKU](https://socket-jon.herokuapp.com/)

*It is best to open multiple windows/tabs of the site in order to see its features.*

##About

This is a personal project that I have been working on. It's kind of rough, but I plan to add a few more features and make it less ugly over time.

I started off using [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and added stuff to the example on the website.


###TO DO
- Add private messaging
- Online user menu should retract to side (go out on hover?)
- Make it pretty and appealing
  - Fonts need to change
  - Colored background... not sure what to do (I don't like the alternating colors)
- Require a username - don't use `alert()`

###TO CONSIDER
- Store messages offline
