#Socket.IO

[PROJECT'S WEBSITE ON HEROKU](https://socket-jon.herokuapp.com/)

*It is best to open multiple windows/tabs of the site in order to see its features.*

##About

This is a personal project that I have been working on. It's kind of rough, but I plan to add a few more features and make it less ugly over time.

I started off using [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and added stuff to the example on the website.
