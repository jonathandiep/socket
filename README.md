#Socket.IO

This is a project that I have been working on recently. It's rough, but I plan to add a few more features over time and make it less ugly.

I started off using [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and added stuff to the example on the website.


###TO DO
- Add private messaging
- Online user menu should retract to side (go out on hover?)
- Make it pretty and appealing
  - Fonts need to change
  - Colored background... not sure what to do (I don't like the alternating colors)


###TO CONSIDER
- Store messages offline
